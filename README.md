Serverless Email Marketing Application:

Creating a serverless email marketing application using only AWS services such as Amazon EventBridge, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and Amazon SES provides a 
highly scalable and cost-efficient solution. In this setup, email templates and recipient lists are stored in S3 buckets. Amazon EventBridge is used to schedule and 
manage email campaigns by triggering events at specified times. These events invoke AWS Lambda functions, which process the email content and recipient information. 
Finally, Amazon SES is used to send the emails to the designated recipients. This architecture leverages the serverless nature of these AWS services, ensuring that the 
application can scale automatically to handle varying loads without the need for server management, and only incurs costs based on actual usage.
